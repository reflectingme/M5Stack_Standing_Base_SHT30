# Alternate Code for M5Stack BCT Standing Base

NB: Please note I am not a professional coder, you are free to use this code as you wish but its use is entirely at your own risk.  

This is a very simple alternate script, modified from the original M5Stack code for the SHT30 temperature and pressure sensor contained in the BCT Standing Base unit for the M5Stack module.  It is not meant to be anything grand, simply a straightforward replacement for the M5Stack demo code for the BCT Standing Base.

If you do experience any problems with the codw, or if you have suggestions as to how this very basic code could be improved (please remember I am simply a self taught developer, and most certainly not a seasoned professional), please do get in touch, I will respond to any issues reported as and when I am able to.

 ## What running this code should look like on your M5Stack screen

 I have not added anything complex, I simply use some of the graphics methods already included in the M5Stack.h library.


Make sure you have the correct and up-to-date libraries installed for the M5Unit-Env.  The files are available from M5Stack here:

https://github.com/Tinyu-Zhao/M5Unit-ENV

If you have been experiencing issues getting the M5Stack Standing Base to show any temperature or humidity data, you may need to remove the original M5Unit-ENV from your /libraries flder then pull and replace the whole library with the one from this URL.
